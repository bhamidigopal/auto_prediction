 
Feature: Vehicle Safety Testing

  Scenario: Basic Safety Rating Validation
    Given the vehicle is an AUDI A3 from the year 2022
    When we check its overall safety rating
    Then the safety rating should be nan

  Scenario: Advanced Safety Feature Verification
    Given the vehicle is equipped with the following safety features:
      - Front Collision Warning: Standard
      - Lane Departure Warning: Standard
      - Crash Imminent Brake: Standard
      - Dynamic Brake Support: Standard
      - Blind Spot Detection: Standard
    When we activate the Front Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, and Blind Spot Detection
    Then the system should alert the driver appropriately

  Scenario: NHTSA Compliance Checks
    Given the vehicle is an AUDI A3 from the year 2022
    When we compare its safety features with the NHTSA's safety standards
    Then the vehicle should meet or exceed all NHTSA safety requirements

  Scenario: Crash Test Performance Validation
    Given the vehicle is an AUDI A3 from the year 2022
    When we conduct a crash test on the vehicle
    Then the vehicle should pass with no major damages

In this improved conversation, I have added more specific scenarios to test the vehicle's safety features and ensure compliance with NHTSA standards. The feature file now includes a more comprehensive set of tests to cover various aspects of the vehicle's safety.
